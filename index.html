Most people think apples as red but this apple decided to go green.
<h3> apples stance on climage change </h3>
Acording to apple "We believe climate change is real. And that it's a real problem. As a global company that makes some of the most popular products in the world, we know we use a lot of energy and material, which in turn generates greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. That's the part of the problem we can help solve."
apple goes on to say that all of it's products go beyond EnergyStar's strict standards.
